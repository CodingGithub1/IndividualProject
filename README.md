# BULLSEYE BANANZA

## Description: 
#### My project is named Bullseye Bonanza. Just like its name suggests, my game will test users ability to hit a target. Starting off, players are welcomed in the game with a welcoming startscreen. They are then provided with a button to start the game. This game is challenging and engaging as well, thanks to its multi-level and difficulty system. The game ends when user beats all the levels or when the timer beats the user. At the endscreen, user is provided with a score based on how many targets they had succesfully hit.
