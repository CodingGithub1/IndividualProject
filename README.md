# BULLSEYE BANANZA

## Description: 
#### My project is named Bullseye Bonanza. Just like its name suggests, my game will test users ability to hit a target. Starting off, players are welcomed in the game with a welcoming startscreen. They are then provided with a button to start the game. This game is challenging and engaging as well, thanks to its multi-level and difficulty system. The game ends when user beats all the levels or when the timer beats the user. At the endscreen, user is provided with a score based on how many targets they had succesfully hit. 

## Project Objective:
#### Lets talk about features and objectives!! This game can be played by all users for fun, aswell as to test their skills. Gamers, specifically people who likes to play first person and third person shooter games can use this app to train and hone their aiming skills. The users will be served with challenges like idle targets, moving targets, horizontal and vertical moving tagets, and faster moving targets. Overall, the main objective of this game is to allow users to have fun while testing their skills.
